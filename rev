ex sheet on Mikkola's algorith was unnecessarily confusing.

I attended all the tutorials, but mostly out of politeness, as they were really
slow, due to covering the homework in detail, which we had to do ...


I would suggest to cover some new material, solving some different excersizes
during the tutorials which was not part of the homework.

We very often did not use the full ~90 minutes, as we were done early.
